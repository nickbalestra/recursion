Recursion
==============

This is a project I completed as a student at Hack Reactor. This project was worked on with a pair. The project aim to explore the use of recursions while reimplementing the following native javascript and DOM methods polyfills:

- getElementByClassName()
- parseJSON()
- stringifyJSON()

**Some code may be written in ES6 and may require to be transpiled in order to be tested**.

### Requirements

ES6 enabled on chrome `chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony.`
Babeljs.io for transipiling.

### Testing

Tests are made with the [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) testing framework.
Test are located in the ./spec directory. To run the Just open the spec runner file with chrome.
